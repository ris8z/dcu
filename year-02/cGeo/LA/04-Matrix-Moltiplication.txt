MOLTIPLICATION MATRIX:

[ 1,  1]
[ 0,  1]   Shear

[ 0, -1]
[ 1,  0]   Rotation

What if we want to applay both transformation?

Shear      Rotation          Shear*Rotation
[ 1,  1] ( [ 0, -1][x] )  =  [ 1, -1] [x]
[ 0,  1] ( [ 1,  0][y] )  =  [ 1,  0] [y]

We can first apply rotaion and then a shear
or we can just applay the moltiplication of these two

Note:

the order matters A*B != B*A

the way of reading is from right to left as function

A * B * C, we are applling first C then B then C

(A * B) * C = A * (B * C)
