BASIS:
    
    When we describe a vector with numbers like:
    v = [3, 2]
    
    3 and 2 are Scalers of two important vectors
    i = [1,0]         j = [0,1]

    in fact we can rappresnt v ad the sum of these two vector
    scaled by 3 and 2

    v = 3 * i + 2 * j = 3 * [1, 0] + 2 * [0, 1] =
    [3, 0] + [0, 2] = [3 + 0, 0 + 2] = [3, 2]
    
    These two vector i and j are the basis of the xy cordinate system

    Its normal to think that we can choose two different basis and get another
    cordinate system and that is right in fact:

    Any time we display a vector numerically it depends on the implicit choice
    of what basis vector we're using.


DISCLAIMER HOW TO THINK ABOUT VECTORS AS:
    Arrow
        think about arrow when you're dealing with single vectors,
    Points (rappresent the tip of the arrow, while the tail is always on the origin)
        think about points we you're dealing with collection of vectors.

LINEAR COMBINATION:
    
    We used linear combinetion before to get v using the i and j vector.
    In fact linear combination is just a wat to rappresent a vector by the sum of two or more scaled vectors.
    
    EXAMPLE:

    k1, k2 two scalers (variables)
    b1, b2 two bases (constants)

    LINEAR COMBINATION:

    k1 * b1 + k2 * b2 = is going to be equal to some vector

    SPAN:

    it's a way of asking what are all the possible vector
    that i can reach using linear combination of my basis

    EXAMPLE:
    by changeing the value of the two scalers we can get different vectors,
    let's pretend that we chose two random basis on the xy plane we have 3 posssiblity

    1) b1 = b2 = 0, we are stuck to zero, we can rapprenset only the vector [0,0]

    2) b1 and b2 are on the same line, we are stuck on that line we can rappresent only number on that line.

    3) in all the other case in the (xy plane) we can rappresent all the vectors on the plane.

    LINEAR DEPDENDENT:

    think about the case 1 and 2, in both these case one vector is redundant,
    1) (if both are 0 you need just one two rappresent 0)
    2) (if both are on the same line you need just one to rappresent that line (by scaling it))

    We you can remove one vector without losing span, they are liner dependent, 
    or in other words one of the vectors can be express as a linear combination of the others (so it's in his span).

    LINEAR INDPENDENT:

    if each new basis add a new dimention to the span so the vectors are linar indipendent.

    EXTRA ON SPAN (3D):

    If we add a third basis to our linear combination, if we are like we get another full dimesion of vector to play with
    in fact unless the third basis land on the plane of the other two we can reach each possible 3d vector.
    Because if we think the 2d plane of the xy as a sheet of paper the third basis z just move that around in the space.

FORMAL DEFINION OF BASIS:

    The basis of a cordinate system are the set of linear independent vetcotrs that span all the space in the system.
