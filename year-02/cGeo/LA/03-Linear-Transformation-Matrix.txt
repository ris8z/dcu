LINEAR TRANSFORMATION:

are way to move around space such that
grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced,
and such that the origin remain fixed


these tranformation can be described using just a few numbers,
the cordinates where each basis vectors (i-hat, j-hat, z-hat) lands.

MATRIX:

give us a language to describe these transformation where the
columns rapresent those cordinates.

[ 3 , 2]
[-2 , 1]

3, -2 is where i-hat lands
2, 1 is where j-hat lands

AND MATRIX VECTOR MOLTIPLICATION:

is just a way to compute what that tranformation does to a given
vector.

[a, b][x] = x*[a] + y*[b] = [ax + by]
[c, d][y]     [c]     [d]   [cx + dy]
