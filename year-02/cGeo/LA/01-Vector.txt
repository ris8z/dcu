VECTOR:

    EXAMPLE:
    v = [2,3]

    DEFITION:
    think about an arrow with its tail in the origin, and each number
    in the list is an instuction the get to the tip of the arrow.
    So each vector rappresent a movment.

    ADDITION:
    v = [2,3], c = [1, -2]
    To add two vector you move the tail of the second one on the tip of the
    first, so basically you follow the instruction:

    start:                                        (0, 0)
    2 as x in v (so move 2 to the right in the x) (2, 0)
    3 as y in v (so move 3 up in the y)           (2, 3)
    1 as x in c (so move 1 to the right in the x) (3, 3)
   -2 as y in c (so move 2 down in the y)         (3, 1)

    that is the same to follow the steps given by d = v + c

    d = v + c = [2,3] + [1, -2] = [2 + 1, 3 - 2] = [3, 1]

    MOLTIPLICATION (Scaling)
    v = [2, 3], k = 2
    c = k * v = 2 * [2, 3] = [4, 6]
    
    c is the v vector streched by a factor of two, if the factor (k is < 0)
    the vector is going to be streched by the absolute value of k and then
    flipped.

    KEYPOINT:
    every thing in linear algebra is just a fancy way to use vector addition
    and moltiplication combined.
