# check if django is installend
    python3 -m django

#create the project folder
    python3 -m django startproject firstproject

#go in that folder
    cd firstproject

#test out the server
    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to view the default django page.

#after then open the folder in vscode





#create the app folder
    python3 -m django startapp firstapp

#open settings.py and add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS list

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
            'django.contrib.admin',
            'django.contrib.auth',
            'django.contrib.contenttypes',
            'django.contrib.sessions',
            'django.contrib.messages',
            'django.contrib.staticfiles',
            'firstapp', #Replace with your app name
        ]




#Creating an home page for the app
#Mapping the projects urls to the apps urls
    1) Inside your django application foder create a new file called urls.py

    2) Opend the django project urls.py and add this to link it to the application urls

        from django.contrib import admin
        from django.urls import path, include


        urlpatterns = [
            path('', include('firstapp.urls')),
            path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        ]

#add the HTML files
    1)Inside your app folder create a new folder called templates

    2)Inside the templates folder create a new file called index.html

    <!-- index.html -->
    <html>
	    <head>Hello World</head>
	    <body>
		    <p>Hello world</p>
	    </body>
    </html>

#Create the view in views.py

    1)Inside your views.py add in the code to display the webpage.

    (This is the code that will be triggered when the user requests
    the homepage of our app.
    All it does is returns the index.html file we created to the user. )

        from django.http import HttpResponse
        from django.shortcuts import render

        def index(request):
            return render(request, 'index.html')

#Create the url mapping

    1)Inside your_app_name/urls.py create the url mapping

        from django.urls import path
        from . import views

        urlpatterns = [
            path('', views.index, name="index")
        ]


#Check your first url
    1)Run your server
        python manage.py runserver
    2)and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser.




#create the first page:

1)python3 -m startproject pj1
2)cd pj1
3)python3 -m startapp app1

we need to link the app1 to our project so

4) in settings.py of our prj folder we add the name of our app1 in installed_apps
5) we create a file urls.py in our app1 folder
6) we link that file the urls.py in our project folder
    #rember to import include: from django.url import path, include
    #add: path('', include('app1.urls'), into the urlpatterns

7) solito: create html file, add a views for it (import render, HttpResponse, from shortcuts and http),
create a url liked to the views(from . import views)



# Exercises
following the steps for urls, views and templates can you 

- Create another page ? e.g. a contact us page
    - e.g. `path('/contact', views.index, name="index")` 
      would run the views.index function if I go to `127.0.0.1:8000`

    - Can you link between the two pages using an `<a>` tag?


1) create an html file for the contact(into the templates folder) us page like contact.html
2) we need to create a function to handle the request of contact in views.py
3) we define the url in the urls.py file that is linked to his function in views.py
4) We can link the two pages using <a href="{% url 'name' %}">test to click<a/>
where name is the name the we defined in the urls.py (name='contact')


So to add a page to our website we need
1)An html file in the templates folder
2)A function to handle the request of that html in the views.py
3)an url liked to that function by the urls.py (into the app folder), where we set a name for that url
4)and possibile a link with <a href="{% url 'name' %}"
